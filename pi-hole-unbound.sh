    # Reduce EDNS reassembly buffer size.
    # IP fragmentation is unreliable on the Internet today, and can cause
    # transmission failures when large DNS messages are sent via UDP. Even
    # when fragmentation does work, it may not be secure; it is theoretically
    # possible to spoof parts of a fragmented DNS message, without easy
    # detection at the receiving end. Recently, there was an excellent study
    # >>> Defragmenting DNS - Determining the optimal maximum UDP response size for DNS <<<
    # by Axel Koolhaas, and Tjeerd Slokker (https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/36/contributions/776/)
    # in collaboration with NLnet Labs explored DNS using real world data from the
    # the RIPE Atlas probes and the researchers suggested different values for
    # IPv4 and IPv6 and in different scenarios. They advise that servers should
    # be configured to limit DNS messages sent over UDP to a size that will not
    # trigger fragmentation on typical network links. DNS servers can switch
    # from UDP to TCP when a DNS response is too big to fit in this limited
    # buffer size. This value has also been suggested in DNS Flag Day 2020.

# Debian Bullseye+ releases auto-install a package called openresolv with a certain 
# configuration that will cause unexpected behaviour for pihole and unbound. The effect 
# is that the unbound-resolvconf.service instructs resolvconf to write unbound's own 
# DNS service at nameserver 127.0.0.1 , but without the 5335 port, into the file 
# /etc/resolv.conf. That /etc/resolv.conf file is used by local services/processes to 
# determine DNS servers configured. You need to edit the configuration file and disable 
# the service to work-around the misconfiguration.
